/**
 * This class handles the {@link Intent#ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED} broadcast intent when this IME
 * package has been replaced by a newer version of the same package. This class also handles
 * {@link Intent#ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED} and {@link Intent#ACTION_USER_INITIALIZE} broadcast intent.
 *
 * If this IME has already been installed in the system image and a new version of this IME has
 * been installed, {@link Intent#ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED} is received to this class to hide the
 * setup wizard's icon.
 *
 * If this IME has already been installed in the data partition and a new version of this IME has
 * been installed, {@link Intent#ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED} is forwarded to this class but it
 * will not hide the setup wizard's icon, and the icon will appear on the launcher.
 *
 * If this IME hasn't been installed yet and has been newly installed, no
 * {@link Intent#ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED} will be sent and the setup wizard's icon will appear
 * on the launcher.
 *
 * When the device has been booted, {@link Intent#ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED} is forwarded to this class
 * to check whether the setup wizard's icon should be appeared or not on the launcher
 * depending on which partition this IME is installed.
 *
 * When a multiuser account has been created, {@link Intent#ACTION_USER_INITIALIZE} is forwarded to
 * this class to check whether the setup wizard's icon should be appeared or not on the launcher
 * depending on which partition this IME is installed.
